        <h1 class="title">Dear Netlify,</h1>
        <p> Thank you for creating such a great place to intern and learn. 
            We have learned so much doing our time here, and more importantly we have loved
            getting to know everyone and being apart of the Netlify and JAMstack communities.
            With a majority of remoties, we thought building a quick website with Netlify was 
            the best way to say goodbye and thank you to everyone. If you are interested, 
            we'd love if you filled out the form on the right to stay in touch so we know 
            the best ways to contact you outside of Netlify.
        </p>
